# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

# Project Overview

This project predicts **house sale prices** using machine learning techniques. It covers the **complete ML pipeline**: data analysis, preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

Two models are used:

1] Support Vector Regression (SVR)
2] Random Forest Regressor

The goal is to understand how real-world ML projects are structured and how model performance is evaluated.



# Dataset

* Source: `HousePricePrediction.xlsx`
* Target variable: **SalePrice**
* Contains numerical and categorical features
